Introduction to Deep Learning: Final Project
For the final project, you will identify a Deep Learning problem to perform EDA and model analysis. This should show a Deep Learning problem description, EDA procedure, analysis (model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion.

Deep Learning problem description
The goal of this project is to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat, using the Kaggle dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats, which was originally provided by Microsoft Research.

This dataset contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats, which are correctly labelled (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

This type of image classification is well suited to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which to a good job of extracting visual features from images.
